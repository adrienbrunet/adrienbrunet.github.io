# Factory - fixtures replacement tool for Node

[Factory](https://github.com/teamMay/factory) is a fixtures replacement tool. It aims to replace static and hard to maintain fixtures with factories üè≠.

![factory](/assets/images/factory.jpg)

In javascript/typescript projects where the test codebase grew larger and larger, I created lots of objects with random or hardcoded values in my integration test setups.
Such task becomes tedious when you get numerous mandatory attributes, and many objects dependencies/relationships that you need to create. And all of that before even writing your first line of "real test". Fixtures can become a pain.

For example, we could have something like:

```typescript
// Hypothesis: we're using something like typeorm with Entity repository
it("myTestedFunction should do xxx with profile and user", async () => {
  // Given
  const user = new User({
    name: 'John',
    phone: '+555123456',
    mail: 'john@mail.com',
    age: 35,
    description: 'Foo bar'
  });
  await user.save();

  const profile = new Profile({
    extraData: 'Foo',
    user
  });
  await profile.save();
  // ...
  // ...

  // When
  const result = await myTestedFunction(profile);

  // Then
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
})
```

While this worked fine for a while, complex tests became unmanageable. It's long to write, long to read and understand, and hard to maintain.

I tried many different libraries but none suited my needs. I used for a very long time [factory-boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io) (also inspired by [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) project) in python projects and I wanted something close to that approach.

I found [factory-builder](https://github.com/stefanvermaas/factory-builder) to be a good start but still, it wasn't exactly what I wanted. It is quite generic and nice to use but it sadly lacks direct typeorm integration. I wanted a direct integration with ORMs, or at least a link to predefined models to leverage type hints and an easier integration with ORMs.

If I wanted specifically a closer integration with [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) to start with, I also plan to move away from it and use the same library for others ORMs or use cases.

## Meet @adrien-may/factory

That's why I created [factory](https://github.com/teamMay/factory). From the example above, we could now have something like:

```typescript
// Factories init
const userFactory = new UserFactory();
const profileFactory = new ProfileFactory();

// Usage
it("myTestedFunction should do xxx with profile and user", async () => {
  // Given
  const user = await userFactory.create();
  const profile = await profileFactory.create({ user });
  // ...

  // When
  const result = await myTestedFunction(profile);

  // Then
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
})
```

We could even define our profile factory so that the user step becomes useless.

## Features

With the first released version, [factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adrien-may/factory) offers to create instances from defined factories which take `model` and `attrs` as properties.

Factories looks pretty much like the following:

```typescript
class UserFactory extends Factory<User> {
  model = User
  attrs = {
    firstName: () => chance.first(),
    lastName: () => chance.last(),
    email: () => chance.email(),
    phone: () => chance.phone(),
    profile: new SubFactory(ProfileFactory)
  }
}
```

So far, we can use it with or without typeorm. Further development would be needed to add compatibility with others ORMs/approach (through new adapters).

We could think of other use cases but for now, here are the implemented features:

- Values resolution from hardcoded values or functions
- Fuzzy generation with [Faker](https://github.com/MilosPaunovic/community-faker), [Chance](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs) or others (implied by value resolution from functions)
- subFactories to re-use factories for relationships (one to one, many to one etc...)
- Sequences | ex: mail ~= `email${n}@example.com` with an auto-incremented "n" value
- lazyAttributes | ex: mail ~= `${firstName}@example.com` where firstName is resolved from the entity
- lazySequence to leverage both sequence and lazyAttributes | ex: mail ~= `${firstName}-${n}@example.com`
- PostGeneration hook to trigger action once instance is created
