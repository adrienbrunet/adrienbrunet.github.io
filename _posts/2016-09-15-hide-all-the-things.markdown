description: Want to hide tiny part of well know websites? Here is a trick.
---

Do you want to hide parts of facebook or twitter? Have a look.

I recently discovered the chrome extension called "Stylish". It allows you to add an extra layer of css on top of the css website. The css being what controls the style of your page.
It means you can tampered any website style. You always dreamed of a pink facebook bar?

First of all... Install Stylish:Seems easy, right?

On facebook, I'm friend with a huge amount of people I met during my life. I haven't spoken to most of them for years. And yet, I can see them in my news feed.
What's the matter?

Well, my news feed is getting jammed with stupider and stupider posts, click bait related or 2-day-old internet jokes.
I could unfriend all this people I'm no longer feeling confortable with. Or tune my news feed to see less stuff from them. But come on, even if it's a two clicks actions, I'm not gonna spend hours doing that 500 times.

I was looking for a better solution but then I realised I don't need that news feed at all
